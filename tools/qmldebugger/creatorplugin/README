The qmldebugger Qt Creator plugin currently builds with Qt Creator 1.3.

To enable this project, qmldebugger.pro requires that these two environment
variables be defined:

CREATOR_SRC_DIR -> source directory for Qt Creator
CREATOR_BUILD_DIR -> build directory for Qt Creator

Once these are defined, run qmake on qmldebugger.pro.

The project will be built into Creator's plugin directory.
