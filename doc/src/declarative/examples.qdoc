\title QML Examples and Walkthroughs

\section1 Running Examples

A \l {qmlviewer}{viewer} application is included that allows you to quickly explore many of the
examples. It has some useful options, revealed by:

\code
    bin/qmlviewer -help
\endcode

There are several illustrative QML examples available.  From your build
directory,

\code
    bin/qmlviewer $QT_SOURCE_DIR/demos/declarative/flickr/flickr-desktop.qml
\endcode
or
\code
    bin/qmlviewer $QT_SOURCE_DIR/demos/declarative/samegame/samegame.qml
\endcode

Many other simple examples can be found under the \c examples/declarative sub
directory.  Some can be run directly using the viewer like those above, and
others require you to build and run an executable.  More sophisticated demos of 
large applications can be found under the \c demos/declarative sub directory. 
These are intended to show more integrated functionality rather than to be 
instructive on specific elements.

\section1 Examples

These will be documented, and demonstrate how to achieve various things in QML.
