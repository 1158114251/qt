\title QML Examples

A viewer application is included that allows you to quickly explore many of the
examples.  It has some useful options, revealed by:

\code
    bin/duiviewer -help
\endcode

There are several illustrative XML examples available.  From your build 
directory, 

\code
    bin/duiviewer $QT_SOURCE_DIR/examples/declarative/mediabrowser/mediabrowser.qml
\endcode

Many other simple demos can be found under the \c examples/declarative sub 
directory.  Some can be run directly using the viewer like those above, and 
others require you to build and run an executable.

Finally, check out the \l {tutorial} to learn a little more about writing your
own QML-based applications.

\note When running applications that only use the Fluid UI atoms under the 
software rasterizer, a simple canvas backend is used by default. To use 
Graphics View instead, set \c QML_USE_GRAPHICSVIEW=1.
