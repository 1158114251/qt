\title Tutorial 3 - States
\target tutorial3

In this chapter, we make this example a little bit more dynamic by introducing states.

We want our text to jump at the bottom of the screen and become red when clicked.

Here is the QML code:

\code
Rectangle {
    id: Page
    width: 480
    height: 200
    color: "LightGrey"
    Text {
        id: HelloText
        text: "Hello world!"
        font.pointSize: 24
        font.bold: true
        y: 30
        anchors.horizontalCenter: Page.horizontalCenter
        states: [
            State {
                name: "down"
                when: MouseRegion.pressed == true
                PropertyChanges { target: HelloText; y: 160; color: "red" }
            }
        ]
        transitions: [
            Transition {
                from: "*"
                to: "down"
                reversible: true
                ParallelAnimation {
                    NumberAnimation {
                        properties: "y"
                        duration: 500
                        easing: "easeOutBounce"
                    }
                    ColorAnimation { property: "color"; duration: 500 }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    MouseRegion { id: MouseRegion; anchors.fill: HelloText }
    Grid {
        id: ColorPicker
        x: 0
        anchors.bottom: Page.bottom
        width: 120; height: 50
        rows: 2; columns: 3
        Cell { color: "#ff0000" }
        Cell { color: "#00ff00" }
        Cell { color: "#0000ff" }
        Cell { color: "#ffff00" }
        Cell { color: "#00ffff" }
        Cell { color: "#ff00ff" }
    }
}
\endcode

\section1 Walkthrough

\code
states: [
    State {
        name: "down"
        when: MouseRegion.pressed == true
        PropertyChanges { target: HelloText; y: 160; color: "red" }
    }
]
\endcode

First, we create a new state \e down for our text element. This state will be activated when MouseRegion is pressed, and deactivated when it is released.

The \e down state includes a set of property changes from our implicit \e {default state} (the items as they were initially defined in the QML). Specifically, we set the \c y property of the text to 160 and the \c color to red.

\code
Transition {
    from: "*"
    to: "down"
    reversible: true
}
\endcode

Because we don't want the text to appear at the bottom instantly but rather move smoothly, we add a transition between our two states.

\c from and \c to define the states between which the transition will run. In this case, we want a transition from any state to our \e down state.

Because we want the same transition to be run in reverse when changing back from the \e down state to the default state, we set \c reversible to \c true. This is equivalent to writing the two transitions separately.

\code
ParallelAnimation {
    NumberAnimation {
        properties: "y"
        duration: 500
        easing: "easeOutBounce"
    }
    ColorAnimation { property: "color"; duration: 500 }
}
\endcode

The \c ParallelAnimation element makes sure that the two animations (color and position) will start at the same time. We could also run them one after the other by using \c SequentialAnimation instead.

For more details on states and transitions, see \l {states-transitions}{States and Transitions}.
