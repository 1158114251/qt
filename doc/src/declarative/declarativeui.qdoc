\title Declarative UI (QML)
\page declarativeui.html

\brief The Qt Declarative module provides a declarative framework for building
highly dynamic, custom user interfaces.

Qt Declarative UI provides a declarative framework for building highly dynamic, custom
user interfaces.  Declarative UI helps programmers and designers collaborate to build 
the animation rich, fluid user interfaces that are becoming common in portable 
consumer devices, such as mobile phones, media players, set-top boxes and netbooks.  
The Qt Declarative module provides an engine for interpreting the declarative QML 
language, and a rich set of \l {QML Elements}{QML elements} that can be used
from QML.

QML is an extension to \l {http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm}
{ECMAScript}, that provides a mechanism to declaratively build an object tree
of QML elements.  QML improves the integration between ECMAScript and Qt's
existing QObject based type system, adds support for automatic
\l {Property Binding}{property bindings} and provides \l {Network Transparency}{network transparency} at the language
level.

The QML elements are a sophisticated set of graphical and behavioral building
blocks.  These different elements are combined together in \l {QML Documents}{QML documents} to build components
ranging in complexity from simple buttons and sliders, to complete
internet-enabled applications like a \l {http://www.flickr.com}{Flickr} photo browser.

Qt Declarative builds on \l {QML for Qt programmers}{Qt's existing strengths}.
QML can be be used to incrementally extend an existing application or to build
completely new applications.  QML is fully \l {Extending QML}{extensible from C++}.
