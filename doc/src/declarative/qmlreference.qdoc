    QML is a language for building highly dynamic and fluid applications. It is targetted at the sorts of user
    interface (and the sorts of hardware) in embedded devices such as phones, media
    players, and set-top boxes. It is also appropriate for highly custom desktop
    user-interfaces, or special elements in more traditional desktop
    user-interfaces.

    Building fluid applications is done declaratively, rather than procedurally.
    That is, you specify \e what the UI should look like and how it should behave
    rather than specifying step-by-step \e how to build it.  Specifying a UI declaratively
    does not just include the layout of the interface items, but also the way each
    individual item looks and behaves and the overall flow of the application.
