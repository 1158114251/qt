This first program is a very simple "Hello world" example that introduces some basic QML concepts.
The picture below is a screenshot of this program.

Here is the QML code for the application:

\section1 Walkthrough

\section2 Import

First, we need to import the types that we need for this example. Most QML files will import the built-in QML
types (like \l{Rectangle}, \l{Image}, ...) that come with Qt with:

\section2 Rectangle element

\snippet examples/declarative/tutorials/helloworld/t1/tutorial1.qml 1

We declare a root element of type \l{Rectangle}. It is one of the basic building blocks you can use to create an application in QML.
We give it an \c{id} to be able to refer to it later. In this case, we call it \e page. We also set the \c width, \c height and \c color properties.
The \l{Rectangle} element contains many other properties (such as \c x and \c y), but these are left at their default values.

\section2 Text element

\snippet examples/declarative/tutorials/helloworld/t1/tutorial1.qml 2

We add a \l Text element as a child of our root element that will display the text 'Hello world!'.

The \c y property is used to position the text vertically at 30 pixels from the top of its parent.

The \c font.pointSize and \c font.bold properties are related to fonts and use the \l{Dot Properties}{dot notation}.

The \c anchors.horizontalCenter property refers to the horizontal center of an element.
In this case, we specify that our text element should be horizontally centered in the \e page element (see \l{anchor-layout}{Anchor-based Layout}).

\section2 Viewing the example

To view what you have created, run the qmlviewer (located in the \c bin directory) with your filename as the first argument. For example, to run the provided completed Tutorial 1 example from the install location, you would type:

\code
bin/qmlviewer $QTDIR/examples/declarative/tutorials/helloworld/t1/tutorial1.qml
\endcode
