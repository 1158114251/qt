    This page documents the \e{Declarative UI Viewer} for the Qt GUI
    toolkit. The \c duiviewer reads an XML format declarative user interface definition
    (\c .qml) file
    and displays the user interface it describes.

    \section1 Options

    When run with the \c -help option, duiviewer shows available options.

    \section1 Dummy Data

    One use of duiviewer is to allow QML files to be viewed stand-alone,
    rather than being loaded from within a Qt program. Qt applications will
    usually bind objects and properties into the execution context before
    running the QML. To stand-in for such bindings, you can provide dummy
    data: create a directory called "dummydata" in the same directory as
    the target QML file and create files there with the "qml" extension.
    All such files will be loaded as QML objects and bound to the root
    context as a property with the name of the file (without ".qml").

    For example, if the Qt application has a "clock.time" property
    that is a qreal from 0 to 86400 representing the number of seconds since
    midnight, dummy data for this could be provided by \c dummydata/clock.qml:
    \code
        <Object>
            <properties>
                <Property name="time" value="12345"/>
            </properties>
        </Object>
    \endcode
    Any QML can be used in the dummy data files. You could even animate the
    fictional data!
