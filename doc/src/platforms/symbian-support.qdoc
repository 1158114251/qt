    \title Qt for Symbian
    \ingroup platform-specific
    \brief Information about the state of support for the Symbian platform.

    Qt for Symbian is not yet fully on a par with other platforms with respect
    to stability and feature support. This page documents the current shortcomings
    of the Symbian port.

    \section1 Source Compatibility

    Qt for Symbian provides the same level of source compatibility guarantee as
    given for other platforms. Â That is, a program which compiles against a given
    version of Qt for Symbian will also compile against all future versions of the
    same major release.

    \section1 Binary Compatibility

    As with every supported platform, we will strive to maintain
    application behavior and binary compatibility throughout the lifetime of
    the Qt 4.x series. However, due to the fact that Symbian support is newly
    added in 4.6.0, there is a slight possibility that minor corrections to the
    ABI might be required in 4.6.1, in order to ensure compatibility going
    forward. Any such change will be clearly documented in the release notes
    for 4.6.1.

    \section1 Supported Devices

    Qt should generally work on any device which runs one of the following
    versions of Symbian:

    \table
    \header \o Symbian Version
    \row \o S60 3.1
    \row \o S60 3.2
    \row \o S60 5.0 (Symbian ^1)
    \endtable

    Qt has received Tier 1 testing on the following phone models:

    \table
    \header \o Phone
    \row    \o Nokia 5800
    \row    \o Nokia E71
    \row    \o Nokia E72
    \row    \o Nokia N78
    \row    \o Nokia N95
    \row    \o Nokia N97
    \row    \o Samsung i8910
    \endtable

    \section1 Supported Functionality

    The following technologies and classes are not currently supported:

    \table
    \header \o Technology
            \o Note
    \row    \o QtConcurrent
            \o Planned for some future release
    \row    \o QtDBus
            \o No current plans to support this feature.
    \row    \o QtOpenGL ES
            \o Planned for some future release
    \row    \o Printing support
            \o No current plans to support this feature.
    \row    \o Qt3Support
            \o No current plans to support this feature.
    \endtable

    The following technologies have limited support:

    \table
    \header \o Technology
            \o Note
    \row    \o QtSql
            \o The only driver supported is SQLite.
    \row    \o QtMultimedia
            \o Although the module itself is supported, no backend for Symbian
               is currently available. However, there is a backend available
               for Phonon.
    \endtable

    \section1 Known Issues

    Known issues can be found by visiting the
    \l{http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/Qt460KnownIssues}{wiki page} with an
    up-to-date list of known issues, and the list of bugs can be found by
