    \title Qt for Symbian
    \ingroup platform-specific
    \brief Information about the state of support for the Symbian platform.

    Qt for Symbian is not yet fully on a par with other platforms with respect
    to stability and feature support. This page documents the current shortcomings
    of the Symbian port.

    \section1 Source Compatibility

    Qt for Symbian provides the same level of source compatibility guarantee as
    given for other platforms. Â That is, a program which compiles against a
    given version of Qt for Symbian will also compile against all future versions.

    \section1 Binary Compatibility

    As with every supported platform, we will strive to maintain
    application behavior and binary compatibility throughout the lifetime of
    the Qt 4.x series. However, due to the fact that Symbian support is
    newly added in 4.6.0, it is possible that minor corrections to the
    behavior and to the ABI in 4.6.1 will be required in order to ensure
    compatibility going forward.


    \section1 Supported Devices

    Qt should work on all phones which run one of the following versions of S60:

    \table
    \header \o S60 version
    \row \o 3.1
    \row \o 3.2
    \row \o 5.0
    \endtable

    Qt has received Tier 1 testing on the following phone models:

    \table
    \header \o Phone
    \row    \o Nokia E71
    \row    \o Nokia E72
    \row    \o Nokia 5800
    \endtable

    \section1 Supported Functionality

    The following technologies and classes are not supported:

    \table
    \header \o Technology
            \o Note
    \row    \o QtConcurrent
            \o
    \row    \o QtDBus
            \o Will never be supported.
    \row    \o QtOpenGL
            \o Support for OpenGL ES may arrive in a future release.
    \row    \o Printing support
            \o
    \row    \o Backend for QtMultimedia
            \o Although the module itself is supported, no backend for Symbian
               is available. However, there is a backend available for Phonon.
    \row    \o Qt3Support
            \o Will never be supported.
    \row    \o QtSql: SQLite as driver
            \o The only driver supported is SQLite.
    \row    \o Developer Tools
            \o Developer tools such as Designer, Assistant and Creator do not
               run on Symbian OS.
    \endtable
