    \brief Classes for secure communication over network sockets.
    \keyword SSL

    The classes below provide support for secure network communication using
    the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, using the \l{OpenSSL Toolkit} to
    perform encryption and protocol handling.

    See the \l{General Qt Requirements} page for information about the
    versions of OpenSSL that are known to work with Qt.

    \note Due to import and export restrictions in some parts of the world, we
    are unable to supply the OpenSSL Toolkit with Qt packages. Developers wishing
    to use SSL communication in their deployed applications should either ensure
    that their users have the appropriate libraries installed, or they should
    consult a suitably qualified legal professional to ensure that applications
    using code from the OpenSSL project are correctly certified for import
    and export in relevant regions of the world.

    When the QtNetwork module is built with SSL support, the library is linked
    against OpenSSL in a way that requires OpenSSL license compliance.
