    \class QGesture
    \since 4.6

    \brief The QGesture class is the base class for implementing custom
    gestures.

    This class represents both an object that recognizes a gesture out of a set
    of input events (a gesture recognizer), and a gesture object itself that
    can be used to get extended information about the triggered gesture.

    The class has a list of properties that can be queried by the user to get
    some gesture-specific parameters (for example, an offset of a Pan gesture).

    Usually gesture recognizer implements a state machine, storing its state
    internally in the recognizer object. The recognizer receives input events
    through the \l{QGesture::}{filterEvent()} virtual function and decides
    whether the event should change the state of the recognizer by emitting an
    appropriate signal.

    Input events should be either fed to the recognizer one by one with a
    filterEvent() function, or the gesture recognizer should be attached to an
    object it filters events for by specifying it as a parent object. The
    QGesture object installs itself as an event filter to the parent object
    automatically, the unsetObject() function should be used to remove an event
    filter from the parent object. To make a
    gesture that operates on a QGraphicsItem, both the appropriate QGraphicsView
    should be passed as a parent object and setGraphicsItem() functions should
    be used to attach a gesture to a graphics item.

    This is a base class, to create a custom gesture type, you should subclass
    it and implement its pure virtual functions.

    \sa QPanGesture, QTapAndHoldGesture
*/

/*! \fn bool QGesture::filterEvent(QEvent *event)

    Parses input \a event and emits a signal when detects a gesture.

    In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to filter the \a
    event out, i.e. stop it being handled further, return true; otherwise
    return false;

    This is a pure virtual function that needs to be implemented in subclasses.
*/

/*! \fn void QGesture::started()

    The signal is emitted when the gesture is started. Extended information
    about the gesture is contained in the signal sender object.

    In addition to started(), a triggered() signal should also be emitted.
*/

/*! \fn void QGesture::triggered()

    The signal is emitted when the gesture is detected. Extended information
    about the gesture is contained in the signal sender object.
*/

/*! \fn void QGesture::finished()

    The signal is emitted when the gesture is finished. Extended information
    about the gesture is contained in the signal sender object.
*/

/*! \fn void QGesture::cancelled()

    The signal is emitted when the gesture is cancelled, for example the reset()
    function is called while the gesture was in the process of emitting a
    triggered() signal.  Extended information about the gesture is contained in
    the sender object.
