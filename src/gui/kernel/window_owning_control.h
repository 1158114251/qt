// If this is defined, then calling QWidget::winId causes a native window to
// be created for the associated control
#define QWIDGET_OWNS_WINDOW

// If QWIDGET_OWNS_WINDOW is defined, defining this macro means that the
// parent window for the newly created window is the parent widget's winId.
// This in turn means that calling QWidget::winId causes native windows to
// be created for all ancestors of the target widget.
// If this macro is undefined, the parent window is the parent widget's
