    \class QScopedPointer
    \brief The QScopedPointer class stores a pointer to a dynamically allocated object, and deletes it upon destruction.
    \since 4.6
    \reentrant
    \ingroup misc

    Managing heap allocated objects manually is hard and error prone, with the
    common result that code leaks memory and is hard to maintain.
    QScopedPointer is a small utility class that heavily simplifies this by
    assigning stack-based memory ownership to heap allocations, more generally
    called resource acquisition is initialization(RAII).

    QScopedPointer guarantees that the object pointed to will get deleted when
    the current scope dissapears, and it also has no way of releasing
    ownership, hence clearly communicating the lifetime and ownership of the
    object. These guarantees are convenient when reading the code.

    Consider this function which does heap allocations, and have various exit points:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_tools_qscopedpointer.cpp 0

    It's encumbered by the manual delete calls. With QScopedPointer, the code
    can be simplified to:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_tools_qscopedpointer.cpp 1

    The code the compiler generates for QScopedPointer is the same as when
    writing it manually. Code that makes use of \a delete are candidates for
    QScopedPointer usage(and if not, possibly another type of smart pointer
    such as QSharedPointer). QScopedPointer intentionally has no copy
    constructor or assignment operator, such that ownership and lifetime is
    clearly communicated.

    The const qualification on a regular C++ pointer can also be expressed with
    a QScopedPointer:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_tools_qscopedpointer.cpp 2

    \note QScopedPointer does not work with arrays.

    \sa QSharedPointer
*/

/*!
    \fn QScopedPointer::QScopedPointer(T *p = 0)

    Constructs this QScopedPointer instance and sets its pointer to \a p.
*/

/*!
    \fn QScopedPointer::~QScopedPointer()

    Destroys this QScopedPointer object. Delete the object its pointer points
    to.
*/

/*!
    \fn T *QScopedPointer::data() const

    Returns the value of the pointer referenced by this object. QScopedPointer
    still owns the object pointed to.
*/

/*!
    \fn T &QScopedPointer::operator*() const

    Provides access to the scoped pointer's object.

    If the contained pointer is \c null, behavior is undefined.
    \sa isNull()
*/

/*!
    \fn T *QScopedPointer::operator->() const

    Provides access to the scoped pointer's object.

    If the contained pointer is \c null, behavior is undefined.

    \sa isNull()
*/

/*!
    \fn QScopedPointer::operator bool() const

    Returns \c true if this object is not \c null. This function is suitable
    for use in \tt if-constructs, like:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_tools_qscopedpointer.cpp 3

    \sa isNull()
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QScopedPointer::isNull() const

    Returns \c true if this object is holding a pointer that is \c null.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QScopedPointer::reset(T *other = 0)

    Deletes the existing object it is pointing to if any, and sets its pointer to
    \a other. QScopedPointer now owns \a other and will delete it in its
    destructor.

    If \a other is equal to the value returned by data(), behavior is
    undefined.
*/

/*!
    \fn T *QScopedPointer::take()

    Returns the value of the pointer referenced by this object. The pointer of this
    QScopedPointer object will be reset to \c null.
