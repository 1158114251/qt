    \brief The QLatin1Literal class provides a thin wrapper around string
    literals used in source code.

    \ingroup tools
    \ingroup shared
    \ingroup text
    \mainclass

    Unlike \c QLatin1String, a \c QLatin1Literal can retrieve its size
    without iterating over the literal.

    The main use of \c QLatin1Literal is in conjunction with \c QStringBuilder
    to reduce the number of reallocations needed to build up a string from
    smaller chunks.

    \class QStringBuilder
    \reentrant
    \since 4.6

    \brief QStringBuilder is a template class that provides a facility to build
    up QStrings from smaller chunks.

    \ingroup tools
    \ingroup shared
    \ingroup text
    \mainclass

    When creating strings from smaller chunks, typically \c QString::operator+()
    is used, resulting in \i{n - 1} reallocations when operating on \i{n} chunks.

    QStringBuilder uses expression templates to collect the individual parts,
    compute the total size, allocate memory for the resulting QString object,
    and copy the contents of the chunks into the result.

    The QStringBuilder class is not to be used explicitly in user code.
    Instances of the class are created as return values of the operator%()
    function, acting on objects of type \c QString, \c QLatin1String,
    \c QLatin1Literal, \c \QStringRef, \c QChar,
    \c QLatin1Char, and \c char.

    Concatenating strings with operator%() generally yields better
    performance then using \c QString::operator+() on the same chunks
    if there are three or more of them, and performs equally well in other
    cases.

    \sa QLatin1Literal, QString
*/

/* !fn template <class A, class B> QStringBuilder<A, B> operator%(const A &a, const B &b)

    Returns a \c QStringBuilder object that is converted to a QString object
    when assigned to a variable of QString type or passed to a function that
    takes a QString parameter.

    This function is usable with arguments of type \c QString,
    \c QLatin1String, \c QLatin1Literal, \c QStringRef, 
    \c QChar, \c QLatin1Char, and \c char.
