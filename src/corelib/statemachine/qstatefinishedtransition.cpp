  \class QStateFinishedTransition

  \brief The QStateFinishedTransition class provides a transition that triggers when a state is finished.

  \ingroup statemachine

  A state is finished when one of its final child states (a QFinalState) is
  entered; this will cause a QStateFinishedEvent to be generated. The
  QStateFinishedTransition class provides a way of associating a transition
  with such an event. QStateFinishedTransition is part of \l{The State Machine
  Framework}.

  \code
    QStateMachine machine;
    QState *s1 = new QState(machine.rootState());
    QState *s11 = new QState(s1);
    QFinalState *s12 = new QFinalState(s1);
    s11->addTransition(s12);

    QState *s2 = new QState(machine.rootState());
    QStateFinishedTransition *finishedTransition = new QStateFinishedTransition(s1);
    finishedTransition->setTargetState(s2);
    s1->addTransition(finishedTransition);
