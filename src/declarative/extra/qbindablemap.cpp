    \class QBindableMap
    \brief The QBindableMap class allows you to set key-value pairs that can be used in bindings.

    QBindableMap provides a convenient way to expose domain data to the UI layer.
    The following example shows how you might declare data in C++ and then
    access it in QML.

    Setup in C++:
    \code
    //create our data
    QBindableMap ownerData;
    ownerData.setValue("name", QVariant(QString("John Smith")));
    ownerData.setValue("phone", QVariant(QString("555-5555")));

    //expose it to the UI layer
    QmlContext *ctxt = view->bindContext();
    ctxt->setProperty("owner", &data);
    \endcode

    Then, in QML:
    \code
    Text { text: owner.name }
    Text { text: owner.phone }
    \endcode

    The binding is dynamic - whenever a key's value is updated, anything bound to that
    key will be updated as well.

    To detect value changes made in the UI layer you can connect to the changed() signal.
    However, note that changed() is \b NOT emitted when changes are made by calling setValue()
    or clearValue() - it is only emitted when a value is updated from QML.
*/

// is there a more efficient way to store/return keys?
//        (or should we just provide an iterator or something else instead?)
// can we provide a way to clear keys?
// do we want to make any claims regarding key ordering?
// should we have signals for insertion and and deletion -- becoming more model like
// should we emit change for our own changes as well?
// Bug or Feature?: values can be created in QML (owner.somethingElse = "Hello") will create somethingElse property. (need to verify if this is actually the case)
// Bug or Feature?: all values are read-write (there are no read-only values)
