\class QmlScriptString
\brief The QmlScriptString class encapsulates a script and its context.

The QmlScriptString is used by properties that want to accept a script "assignment" from QML.

Normally, the following code would result in a binding being established for the \c script
property.  If the property had a type of QmlScriptString, the script - \e {print(1921)} - itself
would be passed to the property and it could choose how to handle it.

\code
MyType {
    script: print(1921)
}
\endcode
