    \fn void qmlInfo(const QString& message, QObject *object)

    \brief Prints warnings messages that include the file and line number for QML types.

    When QML types display warning messages, it improves tracibility
    if they include the QML file and line number on which the
    particular instance was instantiated.
    
    To include the file and line number, an object must be passed.  If
    the file and line number is not available for that instance
    (either it was not instantiated by the QML engine or location
    information is disabled), "unknown location" will be used instead.

    For example, 

    \code
    qmlInfo(object, tr("component property is a write-once property"));
    \endcode

    prints

    \code
    QML ComponentInstance (unknown location): component property is a write-once property
    \endcode
