/*!
    \class QmlInfo
    \brief The QmlInfo class prints warnings messages that include the file and line number for QML types.

    When QML types display warning messages, it improves tracibility if they include the
    QML file and line number on which the particular instance was instantiated.  
    
    QmlInfo statements work just like regular Qt qDebug() statements.  To include the file
    and line number, an object must be passed.  If the file and line number is not available
    for that instance (either it was not instantiated by the QML engine or location 
    information is disabled), "unknown location" will be used instead.

    For example, 

    \code
    qmlInfo(this) << "component property is a write-once property";
    \endcode

    prints

    \code
    QML ComponentInstance (unknown location): component property is a write-once property
    \endcode

    Construct a QmlInfo, using \a object for file and line number information.
