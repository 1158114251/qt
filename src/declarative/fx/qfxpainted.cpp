    \class QFxPainted
    \brief QFxPainted is an abstract base class for QFxView items that paint using QPainter.

    \ingroup group_coreitems

    This is a convenience class allowing easy use of QPainter within a custom item.
    The contents of the item are cached behind the scenes. Any time you change the contents
    you should call markDirty to make sure the cache is refreshed the next time painting occurs.

    \code
    class GradientRect : public QFxPainted
    {
        Q_OBJECT
    public:
        GradientRect() : QFxPainted()
        {
            connect(this, SIGNAL(widthChanged()), this, SLOT(markDirty()));
            connect(this, SIGNAL(heightChanged()), this, SLOT(markDirty()));
        }

        void paint(QPainter *painter)
        {
            painter->fillRect(0, 0, width(), height(), QBrush(QLinearGradient(0,0,width(),height())));
        }
    };
    \endcode

    \warning Dirty is only ever automatically set by QFxPainted at construction. Any other changes (including resizes) to the item need to be handled by the subclass (as in the example above).
    \warning Frequent calls to markDirty will result in sub-optimal painting performance.
*/

/*!
    Constructs a painted item with parent object \a parent.
*/
QFxPainted::QFxPainted(QFxItem *parent)
  : QFxItem(*(new QFxPaintedPrivate), parent)
{
    //### what options do we need to set?
    setOptions(HasContents, true);
}

/*!
    Destroys the item.
*/
QFxPainted::~QFxPainted()
{

/*! \internal
*/
QFxPainted::QFxPainted(QFxPaintedPrivate &dd, QFxItem *parent)
  : QFxItem(dd, parent)

/*!
    \fn QFxPainted::paint(QPainter *painter)

    Implement this method to paint the item using \a painter.
    The painting will be cached and paint() will only be called again
    if \l markDirty() has been called.
