/*!
    \qmlclass Blur
    \brief The Blur object provides a blur effect.

    A blur effect blurs the source item. This effect is useful for reducing details,
    such as when the source loses focus and you want to draw attention to other
    elements. The level of detail can be modified using the blurRadius property.
    Use blurHint to choose the quality or performance blur hints.

    By default, the blur radius is 5 pixels.

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Blur::blurRadius

    blurRadius controls how blurry an item will appear.
    Using a smaller radius results in a sharper appearance, whereas a bigger
    radius results in a more blurred appearance.

    By default, the blur radius is 5 pixels.
*/
/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration Blur::blurHint

    Use the Qt.PerformanceHint hint to say that you want a faster blur,
    and the Qt.QualityHint hint to say that you prefer a higher quality blur.

    When animating the blur radius it's recommended to use Qt.PerformanceHint.

    By default, the blur hint is Qt.PerformanceHint.

    A grayscale effect renders the source item in shades of gray.

    \img graphicseffect-grayscale.png
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Grayscale::strength

    To what extent the source item is "grayed". A strength of 0.0 is equal to no effect,

    \brief The Colorize object provides a colorize effect.

    A colorize effect renders the source item with a tint of its color.

    By default, the color is light blue.

    \img graphicseffect-colorize.png

/*!
    \qmlproperty color Colorize::color
    The color of the effect.

    By default, the color is light blue.

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Colorize::strength

    To what extent the source item is "colored". A strength of 0.0 is equal to no effect,

    \brief The Pixelize object provides a pixelize effect.

    A pixelize effect renders the source item in lower resolution. The resolution
    can be modified using the pixelSize property.

    By default, the pixel size is 3.

    \img graphicseffect-pixelize.png
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int Pixelize::pixelSize
    The size of a pixel in the effect.

    Setting the pixel size to 2 means two pixels in the source item will be used to
    represent one pixel in the output. Using a bigger size results in lower resolution.

    By default, the pixel size is 3.

/*!
    \qmlclass DropShadow
    \brief The DropShadow object provides a drop shadow effect.

    A drop shadow effect renders the source item with a drop shadow. The color of
    the drop shadow can be modified using the color property. The drop
    shadow offset can be modified using the xOffset and yOffset properties and the blur
    radius of the drop shadow can be changed with the blurRadius property.

    By default, the drop shadow is a semi-transparent dark gray shadow,
    blurred with a radius of 1 at an offset of 8 pixels towards the lower right.

/*!
    \qmlproperty real DropShadow::xOffset
    \qmlproperty real DropShadow::yOffset
    The shadow offset in pixels.

    By default, xOffset and yOffset are 8 pixels.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty real DropShadow::blurRadius
    The blur radius in pixels of the drop shadow.

    Using a smaller radius results in a sharper shadow, whereas using a bigger
    radius results in a more blurred shadow.

    By default, the blur radius is 1 pixel.

/*!
    \qmlclass Opacity
    \brief The Opacity object provides an opacity effect.

    An opacity effect renders the source with an opacity. This effect is useful
    for making the source semi-transparent, similar to a fade-in/fade-out
    sequence. The opacity can be modified using the opacity property.

    By default, the opacity is 0.7.

    \img graphicseffect-opacity.png

/*!
    \qmlproperty real Opacity::opacity
    This property specifies how opaque an item should appear.

    The value should be in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is

    By default, the opacity is 0.7.
