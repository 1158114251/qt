*                          New features                                    *
****************************************************************************

New modules
-----------

- QtSql
    * Implemented QtSql module with sqlite3 backend. For now backend is
      provided only in binary format.
- QtWebkit
    * Experimental webkit build for s60. Can be enabled by passing -webkit to configure.
- Phonon
    * The Phonon library is now part of Qt, but it comes without a backend.
      This means that applications can build and run against the Phonon
      library, but there is currently no S60 backend plugin providing actual
      multimedia playback. Possible alternatives such as Helix and MMF are
      being investigated.

    * Isolated S60 version dependent functionality to S60 version specific
      plugins (qts60plugin_x_y.dll) to make it possible for single build to

      some.
