Qt Platform Abstraction
-----------------------

Qt 4.8 adds a new platform: QPA (also known as Lighthouse). QPA is a replacement
for Qt for Embedded Linux (QWS), making it much easier to port Qt to new platforms.

Third party components
----------------------

 - Updated libpng to version 1.5.1
 - Updated libjpeg to version 8c
 - Updated zlib to version 1.2.5
